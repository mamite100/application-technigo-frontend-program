      <h2>What is a web Cookie?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies is a
        small piece
        of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing a website. Cookies were designed to be a
        reliable mechanism for websites remember stateful information (such as items added in the shopping cart i
        an online store) or to record the
        user's browsing activity (like clicking particular buttons, which pages were visited in
        the past etc). Cookies are a necessary part of the way the web works as well as a source of privacy concerns and
        security
        risks. Cookies allow the website to know a little more about you, so that it can send you the correct websites.

        For example, when you log into Zalando, the Zalando server sends you a cookie with a session ID.
        The next time
        you
        go to Zalando
        after you've logged in, you send Zlando the cookie back so that the server knows who you are, and that
        you've
        logged in. Without cookies, this is harder to achieve.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h2>Why every website wants you to accept its cookies</h2>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Most companies are throwing cookie alerts at you
        because they figure it’s better to be safe than sorry. Should you turn cookies off? Probably not. <br>
        Cookies are like anything online. You should know about them. Cookies can make your online life easier. But they
        also
        should be watched over time to ensure your privacy.
